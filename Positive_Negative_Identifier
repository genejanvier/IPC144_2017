// This is done by Won Ki "Eugene" Lee of IPC144-S1A
// Question 2 - Number 1

// The rules after "if" and "else if" are assigned to compare the typed numbers to 0,
// then displays the results according to the comparison.
// I couldn't help but composing rather sarcastic result because that's my nature hehehe, I hope you understand.
// It takes me more than double hours to another students in the class because I'm very bad with mathematics and logics.
// I wish you could explain terminologies more easily, although I do appreciated how much details you're trying to cover at the class.
// Thank you very much Sukhbir!!
